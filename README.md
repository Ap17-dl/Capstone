Capstone: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Machine Learning Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on regional features in the USA.

Problem Statement

A real estate agent wants to predict house prices. You receive a dataset and use a Linear Regression model to estimate house prices based on region-level characteristics.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes 5,000 observations with the following columns:

Avg. Area Income: Average household income in the city

Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the city

Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms per house in the city

Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms per house in the city

Area Population: Population of the city

Price: The sale price of the house

Address: Physical address of the house

Project Workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize feature distributions and examine relationships between predictors and the target variable.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values, if any.

Encode or drop non-numeric fields like the address.

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

Model Building
Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

Prediction
Use the trained model to predict house prices on new or test data.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ap17-dl/Capstone.git
cd Capstone


Open the Jupyter notebook:

Launch Linear Regression Model.ipynb to explore the data, build the model, and view results.

Run the analysis:

All steps—from EDA to model evaluation—are contained in the notebook. You can also reuse the code for further experimentation.

Key Insights & Usage

This project provides a clear demonstration of a complete machine learning workflow using real-world-style housing data.

You can enhance it by:

Incorporating additional feature engineering.

Trying alternative models like Decision Tree Regressor or Random Forest.

Deploying the trained model via a web app (e.g., Streamlit or Flask).
